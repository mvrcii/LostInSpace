Lost in Space is a simple shooting game, while you can move forward and backward, you are also given the chance to rotate your player around its own center and can thus implicitly shoot in any direction.

There is currently no limit to the shooting speed. 

**Features:**

    - Asteroids / Enemies that spawn with random sizes and velocity and move from the top to the bottom
    - Collisions between Asteroids and Bullets
    - Limitation of shooting speed
    
**Scope:**

    - Additional weapon types (e.g. laser)

**How to play:**

    Clone the repository
    Start the "Start_Game.bat" file
